Neural Network For CS401

A Neural Network I built for a Binary Classification problem in school, attaining 86 percent accuracy on validation set. 
The network was trained on the first 2/3 of the training data in file train-io.txt.
Validation was carried out on the reminaing 1/3 of the training data.

The results of the trained model were used on the test-in.txt set, are printed out to a seperate file test-out.txt.
